# Quarterly Alcohol Consumption Prediction Modeling

This repository contains research and analysis on the Quarterly Alcohol Consumption dataset spanning the years 2000 to 2012, focusing on New Zealand. The dataset comprises 51 quarterly records, providing insights into alcohol consumption patterns over time within the country.

## Introduction

The dataset covers alcohol consumption data in New Zealand from 2000 to 2012, offering a comprehensive view of consumption patterns over 12 years. Through meticulous analysis, the research identifies various temporal patterns, including seasonal variations, long-term trends, and occasional outliers.

## Methodology

The research employs the Moving Average (MA) method for forecasting alcohol consumption, comparing forecasted values with actual consumption levels. Additionally, the Single Exponential Smoothing method and the Holt-Winters model are utilized for predictive analysis.

## Results

Moving Average (5) demonstrates the highest prediction accuracy at 92.66%. The Holt-Winters model outperforms other techniques, achieving a prediction accuracy of 94.99%. However, traditional methods like Moving Average exhibit competitive performance, particularly in scenarios with limited datasets.

## ARIMA Analysis

The research delves into ARIMA modeling, evaluating forecasting performance across different parameter combinations to capture underlying consumption patterns, especially in the presence of cyclicality.

## Least Square Method

The Least Square Method is explored, exhibiting moderate predictive capability with room for improvement, particularly in enhancing accuracy on unseen data.

## Conclusion

The research highlights the effectiveness of advanced forecasting techniques like the Holt-Winters model in capturing nuanced variations in alcohol consumption patterns. It also emphasizes the competitive performance of traditional methods in certain contexts, shedding light on the limitations of neural network models, particularly in sparse dataset scenarios.
